Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

1) Based on "City Latitude vs. Max Temperature," latitudes closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures than latitudes further away from the equater. 

2) Based on "City Latitude vs. Max Humidity" and "City Latitude vs. Cloudiness," latitude does not appear to have a strong relationship with either Humidity or Cloudiness. 

3) Based on "City Latitude vs. Wind Speed," wind speed does not appear to have a correlation with latitude. However, interestingly, the maximum Wind Speed appears to be 40 mph (with the exception of one value, which is over 120 mph).
